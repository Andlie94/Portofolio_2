# Portfolio 
Link live demo: portofolio-2-snowy.vercel.app

This project is a course assignment for the *Portfolio 2* course at Noroff.

The portfolio allows users to browse through products I created during my second year at Noroff. Each product can be accessed individually using its unique ID. All product data is stored in a JSON file and dynamically rendered on the site. 🎤
